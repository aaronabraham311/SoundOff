# SoundOff
I aim to do the following in this project
1. Analyze song patterns in popular SoundCloud music
    * Split it by genre
    * Distinguish by high likes vs low likes (removing outliers like artists with big production crews
    * Create regression model to predict popularity of song based on audio features (https://towardsdatascience.com/music-genre-classification-with-python-c714d032f0d8)

2. Create my own song using GAN
    * No idea how I will achieve this but will do more research

3. Create service that SoundCloud artists can use to predict their song popularity
    * Need to create a Flask app that takes an MP3 and ports it into cloud
    * Run machine learning code in the cloud to pre-process music
    * Output predictions but in visually appealing way
